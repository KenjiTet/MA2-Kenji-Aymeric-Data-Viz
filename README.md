# Data Visualization Project Overview

The goal of this data visualization project is to create an interactive graph that showcases the relationships between actors and directors based on the movies they worked on together. The graph allows users to explore the connections between individuals and gain insights into the movies they collaborated on.

The interactive graph provides an intuitive and engaging way for users to explore the relationships and collaborations between actors and directors. By clicking on the edges, users can see the posters and descriptions of the movies and gain a deeper understanding of the collaborations.

The visualization includes multiple interactive buttons, such as a date cursor that enables users to filter the graph based on the movies made in a specific year or earlier. Similarly, the genre button allows users to see the connections between actors and directors for a particular genre, such as comedy.

This project uses data visualization techniques to present complex information in a clear and concise manner, allowing users to explore and analyze the data in an interactive and engaging way.

# Dataset
[Actor and Movie Dataset](https://github.com/KenjiTet/MA2-Kenji-Aymeric-Data-Viz/tree/main/Dataset/actorfilms.csv)

This dataset contains information about movies and the actors who starred in them. The columns of the dataset are:

  - Actor: the name of the actor who starred in the movie.
  - ActorID: a unique identifier for the actor.
  - Film: the title of the movie.
  - Year: the year the movie was released.
  - Votes: the number of votes the movie received on the website where the data was collected.
  - Rating: the average rating of the movie on the website where the data was collected.
  - FilmID: a unique identifier for the movie.
  - 
The dataset contains multiple rows for each actor, each row corresponding to a different movie that the actor starred in. The dataset includes movies released over     a span of several decades. The number of votes and the rating of the movies are also included, which can be used to analyze the popularity and       quality of the movies. The dataset can be used to explore the careers of different actors, as well as to analyze trends in the movie industry over time.


# Problematic

The need to understand the relationships and collaborations between actors and directors in the film industry is the problem that this project seeks to address. There is a wealth of information available about movies and their creators, but effectively analyzing and comprehending this information can be difficult. This project explores and visualizes the relationships and collaborations between actors and directors in an interactive and intuitive manner.

The primary goal of the project is to assist users in understanding the relationships and collaborations between actors and directors, as well as the films they worked on together. The interactive graph allows users to explore the data in a dynamic and engaging manner, with the option to filter by date and genre, making it easier to analyze and comprehend the information presented.

This project can facilitate new discoveries and insights in the field of film studies by providing a clear and concise representation of the data.

# Target Audience

The target audience for this visualization could be movie enthusiasts, students, researchers, or anyone interested in exploring the relationships between actors and directors in the film industry. It could also be used by filmmakers and producers to identify potential collaborators based on previous collaborations, allowing for more efficient and effective filmmaking.
