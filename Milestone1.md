# Dataset

Our two main datasets [movie_data_per_year](https://github.com/KenjiTet/MA2-Kenji-Aymeric-Data-Viz/tree/main/Dataset/movie_data_per_year) and [movie_poster_per_year](https://github.com/KenjiTet/MA2-Kenji-Aymeric-Data-Viz/tree/main/Dataset/movie_poster_per_year) were originally created as part of a study titled "Movie Genre Classification based on Poster Images with Deep Neural Networks". This study aimed to explore the possibility of classifying movie genres using movie poster images and deep learning techniques. The researchers compiled an extensive collection of movie information and poster images spanning from 1980 to 2015 to serve as the foundation for their analysis.

The [movie_data_per_year](https://github.com/KenjiTet/MA2-Kenji-Aymeric-Data-Viz/tree/main/Dataset/movie_data_per_year) dataset is a comprehensive collection of movie information spanning from 1980 to 2015. Each year has its own text file containing movie data in JSON format. The dataset includes a wide range of information about each movie, such as the IMDb ID, movie title, director, actors, genres, rating, runtime, box office revenue, and more. Notably, it also includes each movie's awards and nominations, providing insight into the film's critical reception.

For example, a movie entry in this dataset might include the IMDb ID 'tt0120915', which corresponds to "Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace". This record would contain the movie's rating ('PG'), runtime ('136 min'), total IMDb votes ('513,986'), response status ('True'), type ('movie'), country of origin ('USA'), and genre ('Action, Adventure, Fantasy'). Additionally, the awards field indicates that the movie was nominated for 3 Oscars and received 17 wins & 60 nominations in other categories. The box office revenue is also provided ('$474,544,677'), along with the writer, director, and main actors involved.

Complementing the movie_data_per_year dataset is the [movie_poster_per_year](https://github.com/KenjiTet/MA2-Kenji-Aymeric-Data-Viz/tree/main/Dataset/movie_poster_per_year) dataset. This dataset is organized into directories for each year from 1980 to 2015 and contains JPEG images of movie posters corresponding to the movies listed in the movie_data_per_year dataset. These images can be used to provide a visual representation of each movie and can be utilized in various applications, such as data visualization, machine learning, or recommendation systems. By combining both datasets, users can access a rich source of movie-related information that can be employed in a wide range of analyses and projects.
