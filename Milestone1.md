# Dataset

Our two main datasets [movie_data_per_year](https://github.com/KenjiTet/MA2-Kenji-Aymeric-Data-Viz/tree/main/Dataset/movie_data_per_year) and [movie_poster_per_year](https://github.com/KenjiTet/MA2-Kenji-Aymeric-Data-Viz/tree/main/Dataset/movie_poster_per_year) were originally created as part of a study titled "Movie Genre Classification based on Poster Images with Deep Neural Networks". This study aimed to explore the possibility of classifying movie genres using movie poster images and deep learning techniques. The researchers compiled an extensive collection of movie information and poster images spanning from 1980 to 2015 to serve as the foundation for their analysis.

The [movie_data_per_year](https://github.com/KenjiTet/MA2-Kenji-Aymeric-Data-Viz/tree/main/Dataset/movie_data_per_year) dataset is a comprehensive collection of movie information spanning from 1980 to 2015. Each year has its own text file containing movie data in JSON format. 
The dataset includes a wide range of information about each movie, such as:

  - _id: A unique identifier for each movie entry in the dataset, typically an ObjectId generated by MongoDB.
  - imdbID: The IMDb identifier for the movie, a unique alphanumeric string (e.g., "tt0120915") that allows you to access the movie's IMDb page.
  - Rated: The Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) rating for the movie, which indicates the suitable audience age group (e.g., "PG", "PG-13", "R").
  - Runtime: The duration of the movie in minutes (e.g., "136 min").
  - imdbVotes: The total number of IMDb user votes for the movie (e.g., "513,986").
  - Response: A boolean value indicating whether the movie information was successfully retrieved ("True" or "False").
  - Type: The type of the entry, usually "movie" for films.
  - Country: The primary country where the movie was produced (e.g., "USA").
  - Genre: A list of genres associated with the movie, separated by commas (e.g., "Action, Adventure, Fantasy").
  - Awards: A description of the awards and nominations the movie has received (e.g., "Nominated for 3 Oscars. Another 17 wins & 60 nominations.").
  - Box_office: The total box office revenue for the movie in US dollars (e.g., "474,544,677").
  - Writer: The main writer or writers responsible for the movie's screenplay (e.g., "George Lucas").
  - Title: The full title of the movie (e.g., "Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace").
  - Metascore: The movie's Metascore, an aggregated rating from professional critics, ranging from 0 to 100 (e.g., "51").
  - Actors: A list of the movie's main actors, separated by commas (e.g., "Liam Neeson, Ewan McGregor, Natalie Portman, Jake Lloyd").
  - imdbRating: The average IMDb user rating for the movie, ranging from 0 to 10 (e.g., "6.5").
  - Released: The release date of the movie (e.g., "19 May 1999").
  - Director: The director of the movie (e.g., "George Lucas").
  - Language: The primary language spoken in the movie (e.g., "English").

Complementing the movie_data_per_year dataset is the [movie_poster_per_year](https://github.com/KenjiTet/MA2-Kenji-Aymeric-Data-Viz/tree/main/Dataset/movie_poster_per_year) dataset. This dataset is organized into directories for each year from 1980 to 2015 and contains JPEG images of movie posters corresponding to the movies listed in the movie_data_per_year dataset. These images can be used to provide a visual representation of each movie and can be utilized in various applications, such as data visualization, machine learning, or recommendation systems. By combining both datasets, users can access a rich source of movie-related information that can be employed in a wide range of analyses and projects.
